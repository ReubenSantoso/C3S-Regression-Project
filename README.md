# CCS Regression with K-Means & SVR

This repository contains code and experiments for predicting ion-neutral collision cross sections (CCS) of small molecules via a clustering-plus-regression pipeline. We extend Ross *et al.*â€™s 2020 work:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1} by coupling K-Means clustering with Support Vector Regression (SVR) and exploring feature variants such as polarization descriptors, MQNs, adducts, and data cleaning logic.

## ðŸš€ Highlights

- **Clustering + Regression Pipeline**  
  1. **K-Means** groups molecules by structural similarity  
  2. **SVR** models trained per cluster for fine-grained CCS prediction  

- **Feature experiments**  
  - **MQNs** (Molecular Quantum Numbers)  
  - **Polarization** descriptors  
  - **Adduct-type** encoding  
  - **Data cleaning** logic vs. **uncleaned** raw data  

- **Key observations**  
  - Adding **polarization** features does not reduced test error.  
  - **Cleaned** datasets (filtered outliers & noisy spectra) does not improve SVR stability.
